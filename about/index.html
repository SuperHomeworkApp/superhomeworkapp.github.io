            Hello! I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/wgramer03">Wilson Gramer</a>,
            the creator of SuperHomework. Below you'll find information about me,
            how SuperHomework was created, and how it is positively impacting
            students, parents, and schools in the community.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've always been a "techie", and when I first arrived at the
            <a href="https://tms.tyngsboroughps.org/">Tyngsboro Middle School</a>, I was
            delighted to learn that most of my teachers were using online resources to post
            homework assignments, distribute textbooks, and grade students' work. Today,
            most schools are connected in a similar way.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, I soon learned that there was quite a lack of organization on
            the very platform designed for such; teachers were using several services, like
            <a href="https://edu.google.com/intl/en/k-12-solutions/classroom/?modal_active=none">
            Google Classroom</a>, homework blogs, <a href="https://www.remind.com/">Remind</a>,
            and so on that provided no compatibility between each other. As a student, I was
            forced to go back and forth between several websites and apps every day in order to
            get caught up on my nightly assignments.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most just gave up and began using "old-school" agenda books, copying the 
            assignment off the board like students have been for generations. But I
            saw a better way — what if there was a single platform that could bring
            all of these services together?
        </p>

        <p>
            This vision has driven me to create a solution, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePQ8SnsOD5UFhJz60nwpNTGcpNsM-u5TeqFnTxkoxEWWwqyw/viewform?usp=sf_link">
            the ideas</a> that I <a href="http://mrsdowneymathclass.blogspot.com/2016/09/wilsons-workflow-app.html">
            have developed</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/TPSHomeworkBot">three years</a>
            have finally culminated into SuperHomework.
        </p>

        <p>
            SuperHomework was conceived in November 2017 as the successor to <a href="https://twitter.com/TPSHomeworkBot">
            TPSHomeworkBot</a>, a Twitter bot that sent a summary of the homework for
            the Tyngsboro Middle School. Although the <a href="https://wgramer.wordpress.com/2017/10/14/tpshomeworkbot-update/">
            concept behind TPSHomeworkBot</a> was solid, I didn't have the time nor experience
            to improve it. In fact, the program in which TPSHomeworkBot was written was stored on a
            <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/">Raspberry Pi Zero</a>
            that was mounted on a shelf in my room! Another problem with TPSHomeworkBot was its
            lack of compatibility with other services — it's true that most teachers in the school
            used homework blogs from which TPSHomework pulled its information, but they were also
            turning toward other solutions like Google Classroom and the like. And even when I
            turned on Twitter notifications, I still didn't feel like the program was personal enough
            for my needs — there's no way to tune a PDF to a user's preferences, after all.
        </p>

        <p>
            At first, SuperHomework was created to fix the issues with TPSHomeworkBot by adding the ability
            to have custom assignments and daily summary notifications. But as I gained more experience in 
            the world of iOS programming — this was my first App Store-intended app, after all — I found myself 
            able to add more advanced features. I remember sitting in US History around January, and my teacher 
            brought up an assignment on Google Classroom for us to work on. It suddenly came to me, <i>why is
            this not in SuperHomework yet?</i> Now, it's only two taps away to sign into Google Classroom within
            the SuperHomework app.
        </p>

        <p>
            After months of beta testing, SuperHomework 1.0 will finally be available publicly in the App Store
            on August 22, 2018. My journey with SuperHomework is only just beginning, and I can't wait to be able
            to help students, parents, and schools in my own community and across the country using a solution
            that I built. If you're a school administrator and you'd like to help me make that a reality, please
